# This is my first website!!
The goal is to create a new homepage for myself

## TO DO:
X 1. Create a Webpage that has a background (solid color for now) and a title (Chrik's Home.)
X 2. Create 8 boxes that can hold images of websites I like (Youtube, Twitch, OP.GG, Canvas, Discord, Netflix, Crunchyroll, Github)
X 3. Make those boxes links.
4. Make this process dynamic so you can add or remove tiles from the website.
