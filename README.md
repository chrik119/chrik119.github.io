# This is my first website!!
The goal is to create a new homepage for myself

## TO DO:
1. X Create a Webpage that has a background (solid color for now) and a title (Chrik's Home.)
2. X Create boxes that can hold images of websites I like (Youtube, Twitch, OP.GG, Canvas, Discord, Netflix, Crunchyroll, Github, etc)
3. X Make those boxes links.
4. Make this process dynamic so you can add or remove tiles from the website.
